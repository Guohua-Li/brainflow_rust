# eegui
Note: this repository is based on a C++ library built on Ubuntu. You need to build your own library if you are using a different platform and replace the one in the brainflow directory.

I am learning EGUI by building a gui for BrainFlow. I was trained to be a neurobiologist, coding is just my passion. Please correct me if you spot any mistakes. 

Under the eegui directory, 

cargo run --bin main
or
cargo run --bin demo1
